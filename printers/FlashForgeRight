# Start gcode
; begin
M73 P0 ; tell the firmware we're starting a build
G130 X118 Y118 Z40 A118 B118  ; set vref's to default
M140 S[first_layer_bed_temperature] ; set bed temp, don't wait
M109 S[first_layer_temperature_1] T1 ; set nozzle temp, don't wait
T0 ; home on the right extruder
G90 ; set positioning to absolute
G28 X Y Z ; home XYZ at default home feedrates
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 A0 B0 ; define this as Z=0, the other coords are technically unnecessary but x3g requires them so gpx will make some up
G1 Z5 ; move the platform 5mm down
G28 Z F500 ; so we can home z again slowly
M132 X Y Z ; Recall stored home offsets
G1 X112 Y-72 Z30 F3300 ; move to waiting position (front right corner of print bed)
M116 ; wait for target temperatures to be reached. GPX only, RepG doesn't understand
G92 E0 ; set current extruder position as 0 so that E15 below makes sense
G1 X110 Y-70 Z[first_layer_height] F2400.0 ; move to just on the bed
G1 X110 Y70 E15 F1200.000 ; extrude a line of filament along the right edge of the bed
G92 E0 ; set E to 0 again because the slicer's next extrusion is relative to this 0

# End gcode
M73 P100 ; end build progress
G162 X Y F2500; home X and Y axes
G0 Z150; lower Z axis to bottom
M18; disable all stepper motors
M109 S0 T0; set bed temperature to 0
M104 S0 T0; set 1st extruder temperature to 0
M104 S0 T1; set 2nd extruder temperature to 0
M70 P5; We <3 Making Things!
M72 P1; Play Ta-Da song
